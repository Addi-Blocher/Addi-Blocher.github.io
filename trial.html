      <div class="desc">This sweater pattern was by YarnCakesLLC on Etsy. I adapted it to be the correct size for me, and to loosen the turtleneck. I liked the patterning of the body and the sleeves.</div>

      <div class="desc">I adapted this pattern from a vintage granny square coat that fell at the waist. I liked the idea of the three ties at the top, because when I walk it flares open in a really nice way.</div>

      <div class="desc">This pattern was by RomanDyreDesigns on Etsy. I had to adapt the pattern to work the way that I wanted to. The original stitch used didn't move the way that I like, so I changed to a regular double crochet which is more flexible.</div>
