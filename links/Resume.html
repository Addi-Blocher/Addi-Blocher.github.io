            <h5>Insomnia</h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director</h6>
                <p>I worked on this project with codirectors <a href="https://mylesaquino.myportfolio.com/">Myles Aquino</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12489471/">Ailin Mo</a> It was my first forray into production design within film, and it turned out great! I had to design a scene that would flip from a dream state to a waking state midway through, and finding props and furniture to replace eachother was the most rewarding part.<p>

            <h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr3QWbSM3Ow">Anxiety in Rhythm</a></h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director</h6>
                <p>I worked on this project with director <a href="https://youtube.com/@austinreed6458">Austin Reed.</a> I was instructed to create two different settings; one that felt very sterile and empty (the bedroom) and one that felt chaotic and loud (the party scene). The goal overall was to create as much color in the party scene as possible, including large strings of colorful christmas lights, and bodies everywhere.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://vimeo.com/656339355?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=115361045">Sino Ako</a></h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director</h6>
                <p>This project was also with director <a href="https://mylesaquino.myportfolio.com/">Myles Aquino.</a> He wanted to create a sense of dissonance, so we used purple and green to create that. My goal was to show our main character as an artist who is confined by the expectations of her family, so her room is clean but colorful and well designed.</p>

            <h5>Channel Yellow</h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director</h6>
                <p>This was a <a href="https://mylesaquino.myportfolio.com/">Myles Aquino</a> directed film. This was a short film project to highlight the anti-asian racism spike that followed the Covid-19 pandemic. I utilized a lot of my connections for this project, and worked a lot with cooperative design.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://vimeo.com/722828908">I Really Wish I Spoke Tigalog</a></h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director</h6>
                <p>This was another project that I designed for <a href="https://mylesaquino.myportfolio.com/">Myles Aquino.</a> This film was a story about a grandson losing his grandfather. There's the added dimension of a language barrier, and cultural difference between the two as well. My goal in this design was to make a space that encapsulated an entire life. I needed to characterize the grandfather through the space and the things that he holds onto.</p>

            <h5>Life on Earth</h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director</h6>
                <p>This film was with director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertcoller">Robert Coller.</a> It follows a washed up astronaut and the guy who replaced him. I focused my design expertise mainly on the bedroom, where I placed a poster of space, and a bunch of drawings ranging from childlike to more intricate. I wanted to show that he's been interested in space since he was old enough to hold a crayon.</p>

            <h5><a href="https://vimeo.com/589083343">Drifting</a></h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Department</h6>
                <p>This production I worked on for <a href="https://mylesaquino.myportfolio.com/">Myles Aquino.</a> I designed each space with a different color palette in mind. This script follows a couple as they go from in love to out of love, so I focused on colors that can be transitional, such as red. Red can be love, red can also be anger. Blue, as well, which can be sadness but also calm. Finally, I added a more sterile black and white, which can be nostalgic or suffocating. I also painted the canvas that is shown in the film.</p>

        <div class="filmright">
            <h5>Ash Over Edinburgh</h5>
                <h6>Costume Designer, Art Department, Writer</h6>
                <p>This was my first international film, with director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-britti-72bbb21b7">Alex Britti.</a> We went as a group to Edinburgh, Scotland, and we spent three weeks writing, shooting, and editing our film. I co-wrote the film and worked creating and sourcing costumes. This was difficult due to the stretch of being in a new country, but with the help of a travel sized sewing machine and a tight budget we managed to pull through with costumes that were surprisingly close to our moodboards.</p>
                
            <h5>Remember(ed)</h5>
                <h6>Co-Director, Writer, Producer, Production Designer, Art Department</h6>
                <p>This movie was my baby for a full year. I wrote it on my own, edited it over the course of six months, and then shot it. The idea was to write a series of monologues focused around the idea of death and legacy. I co-directed with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-britti-72bbb21b7">Alex Britti,</a> and production designed on my own. There was minimal design since the majority of the film takes place outdoors, but there were some prop heavy scenes. I had to find objects that look like mementos from a relationship, wich was particularly challenging since those are often small things acquired over a long period of time.</p>

            <h5>Les Mons Duel</h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Costume Designer, Art Department</h6>
                <p>This film was for director <a href="https://vimeo.com/user108189900">Misha Kuetemeier.</a> I served as production designer, which was difficult due to a very limited budget and the nature of the film as a period peice. I also worked to coordinate betwee our director and a costume shop for costume rentals. Altogether, I believe my budget landed somewhere around $300 for everything, and the film came out great.</p>

            <h5>Scream Your Heart Out</h5>
                <h6>Production Designer, Art Director, Art Department </h6>
                <p>This production design was for director Rob Ruiz. I was challenged in this one because everything was meant to be handmade. I am an artist and a crafter, and I have been for a while. Regardless, the production design and art department on this film took hundreds of hours of crafting time from me. All told, it slotted together well and the various forms of art covered the space beautifully.</p>
            
            <h5>F***</h5>
                <h6>Actor, Production Designer, Art Department</h6>
                <p>This film was just for fun, with director <a href="https://mylesaquino.myportfolio.com/">Myles Aquino.</a> We had a great time directing a film with a very simple premise. I also starred with <a href="https://www.backstage.com/u/abby-mortinsen/">Abby Mortinsen</a> as the ex-boyfriend Don. Overall, this was a fun project with a great premise and a simple design.</p>

            <h5>Fritz</h5>
                <h6>Music Composition and Recording</h6>
                <p>This film was a bit of a unique challenge from director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertcoller">Robert Coller.</a> I haven't done much film music design, however I have experience from high school scoring a show. I am also a multi-instrumentalist, so when it was presented to me I jumped at the opportunity. I scored over the end sequence of the movie, and recorded both parts.</p>

            <h5>Blame</h5>
                <h6>Actor</h6>
                <p>I acted for director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-britti-72bbb21b7">Alex Britti.</a> I starred alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertcoller">Robert Coller</a> in my longest film acting role to date. This one was a fun set to be on, despite the subject matter of the script. It was early in college, so we spent most of our production time grappling with technical aspects, and refining our performances.</p>
