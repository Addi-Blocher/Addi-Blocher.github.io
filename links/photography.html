            <h3> Film and Digital Photography Examples</h3>
            <p>I like to find beauty in the every day, whether I'm writing, designing, or photographing. This point of view has gotten me through some of my personal difficulty, and I think that it's a helpful mindset for those of us who struggle a little more in our own minds. Enjoying the small things and being able to find beauty and intrigue wherever I'm at is what I aim to do, always.</p>

                  <div class="text">The positions that you find yourself in playing pool (not very well if you're anything like me) are fairly unique to that activity. The slant of the shoulders makes a line that cuts through the image and allows for a simplicity and beautiful profile.</div>

                  <div class="text">I walked into this record store and immediately needed to capture the clutered complexity of the interior. I think that the posters on the ceiling are a great way to highlight that, like they had so much they wanted to put up that it couldn't fit on the walls and the shelves alone. The only place left to go was up.</div>
