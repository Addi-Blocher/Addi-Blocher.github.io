<h4>Image Design Projects</h4>
<p>
I dabble in a few different areas of design. Here are some of the projects that I've worked on most recently.
</p>
<p>
    Into the Ocean book 
    Stick season book 
    Remembered Portraits

</p>

    <div class="left">
        <p>This was a project based on the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZES3nJQYJok">Into the Ocean</a> by Blue October.I wanted to theme it after the ocean, but I wanted to add a twist. So, instead of using imagery from the ocean, instead I tried to parallel the ocean to the seas of grass that we have here in Colorado where I grew up. I also wanted to skirt around the color blue, so I used purple and green instead, to allude to the blue of the ocean without using the color outright.</p>

    <p>These portraits I did for a movie that I wrote and co-directed a couple years ago called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17491930/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">Remember(ed)</a> We took stills of all of our characters and our crew from set and I drew these stylized portraits for our credits. A special thanks to our cast and crew for being such wonderful models!</p>
