<h1> Hello, world! </h1>

<p>My name is Addison Blocher, but I go by Addi. I use she/her/hers pronouns and I have a service dog named Copper. He goes with me pretty much everywhere and helps me with my diabilities! I enjoy design in a number of areas, including fiber crafts, digital design, and sewing.</p>

<h2> Here's a youtube video that I enjoy!</h2>
