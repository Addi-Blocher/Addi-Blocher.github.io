<p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, looking to graduate in Spring of 2023. I am earning a major in English, with minors in Creative Technology Design and Theatre. I am a photographer, an illustration/graphic design artist, and a production designer. I play more than 10 instruments competently, and enjoy fiber arts and writing in my free time. I have a service dog named Copper who goes with me almost everywhere I go. I also have a couple of jobs, one at the university as a teaching assistant for the Image class, and one working in home with disabled kids.</p>
